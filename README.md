## Volunteer Registration

![Volunteer](public/images/volunteer.jpg)

**Once a volunteer has `registered`, they will be contacted by the administrator. 
After both a phone interview and an in-person interview, the volunteer must submit to a comprehensive background check prior to being onboarded and `given access to the volunteer login portal`.**

## User Login and Home Page

**The administrator will create a `home page` for each user, i.e. the child in foster care. The user will have input on how they would like their home page to look. Currently there is one `theme`, but additional themes are coming. The user will also select a `cover image` for their photo album.**
